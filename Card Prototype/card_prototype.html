    <h3>The Diplodocus</h3>
    <p>
      It was a widespread species during the late Jurassic, the name derives from the shape of its tailbones, doubled at the end. It's an herbivore, the teeth on the front are thin and small, on the rear there are none. 
      You could find the diplodocus mostly in North America. It's the longest and slowest dinosaur ever existed. They weight between 20 and 25 tons and they could walk just on all fours, being the rear legs unable to sustain that great bulk.
    </p>
    <h3>The Story</h3>
    <p>
      This diplodocus arrived here through a donation of Andrew Carnegio, a scottish entrepreneur who gave it to Vittorio Emanuele II in 1909. Then it was assigned to this museum.
      It's the copy of a fossil that was Carnegio's property (the original was found in Wyoming), other ones were given to other capitals such as Berlin, Wien and Paris.

    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <p>
      The 2016 Emilia's earthquake broke the tail of our diplodocus.
